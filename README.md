# Astros but Without the Cheating (abwoc)
## Project Overview

Despite a century and a half of research, solar flares are generally poorly understood. Science has an idea of how they form, however we are unable to precisely model these flares and prominences. These Solar Events and their associated coronal mass ejections can lead to detrimental effects on Earth systems by disrupting electronics and communication systems, particularly in satellites with limited protection from Earthâ€™s magnetic field. Larger flares, such as the 1859 Carrington Event, pose  existential  threats  to  modern  society  with  the  potential  to  irreparably damage large swaths of the power grid, disable aircraft navigational and computer systems, and disrupt radio communications or military early-warning systems. Given the immediacy of thesethreats, understanding solar events and space weather is a major scientific priority.

Solar flares are generally classified by a peak in total solar intensity at a particular wavelength rather than by imaging of the structure of a flare. So a flare brightest in the x-ray we call an x-ray event. However they emit in a wide range of wavelengths, at different characteristic strengths and timscales. In our semester long project, we used daily reports of solar events from the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC), and images of the Sun in EUV wavelengths to train a convolutional neural network to classify images on whether or not they contain an x-ray flare. If different types of flares carry unique observational signatures held within images of the Sun, this could hint at specific physical mechanisms underlying flares of varying types. The python package abwoc contained in this respository was initially created to be used in our semester long project, and can now be used to more efficiently access Solar Observations from the AIA telescope and train convolutional neural nets on these images. 

## Solar Event Classifier 
```abwoc``` is used for downloading images of solar events in the desired wavelengths from AIA data. These images can then be used to train a CNN to identify to identify the desired solar event. Modules for testing the trained models are also included. 

## Installation
To install, use

```
pip install git+https://github.com/PHYS477677/abwoc
```

## Examples
Examples of usage of ```abwoc``` are provided in the 'demos' directory. Notebooks included are:
- visualization.ipynb &mdash; How to view the AIA images of the Sun
- model_train_eval.ipynb &mdash; How to train and evaluate CNN models on this dataset
