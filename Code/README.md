## Data Science Pipeline

1. Data Loading
    1. Download AIA images based on desired wavelengths and events
    2. Downsize and normalize the images from their native 4096x4096 size, and save these downsized images
    3. Optionally create simulated images to test network structure
2. Neural Network Training
    1. Cache images to machine
    2. Create a model using Keras
    3. Train a preexisting model and Save/Load model weights from checkpoints
3. Model Validation
    1.  Test the performance of a trained model on various data sets
