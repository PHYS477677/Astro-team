This folder contains the files needed to download AIA images to our google drive.

The primary script to run is download_aia.py. In order to run download_aia.py there are a total of 
7 arguments that must be passed in at runtime. They are:

  1. Start year 
  2. End year
  3. Start month
  4. End month
  5. Start day
  6. End day
  7. Event type
  
download_aia.py then queries the table event_df_main.csv and downloads one image for each
space weather event found in event_df_main.csv that matches the requirements specified by the 
7 input arguments given at runtime. It also downloads an additional image, one per located event,
at a time where there was no space weather event present. 
  
As an example, in order to download one AIA image for each X-RAY event that occured during the months of March
and April, the python command would look like:

$ download_aia.py 2015 2016 3 5 1 32 XRA

(Note that the outer bounds on the year/month/day are exclusive. So the above script would not download any data from 2016 or the month of May)
